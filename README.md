Windows 10 Per User WiFi Connectivity

In my home we have a Windows 10 computer in the common area, to be used by my wife, children and I, each one with their own account. The issue is that I have 2 Wi-Fi networks. One for IoT devices and one for common usage. The latter can access printers, KODI players and has QoS enabled, so itâ€™s more appropriate for daily usage. IoT has Home Assistant, Unifi Controller and ZoneMinder so it should only be accessed by me.

The problem with Windows 10 is that when I connect on the IoT network, any other account that logs-in the computer is automatically connected to the IoT network also. So, I needed a way to separate each Wi-Fi network, per user. Follow the guide below to achieve them same.

01. Run the following 2 commands in a command prompt as an administrator.

- netsh wlan set allowexplicitcreds allow=no
- netsh wlan set createalluserprofile enabled=no

This will disable explicit credentials and prevent users from creating network profiles for all users.

This way each user can set up their own WiFi connection.
